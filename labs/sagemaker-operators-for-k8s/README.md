## Amazon SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes

Amazon SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes make it easier for developers and data scientists using Kubernetes to train, tune, and deploy machine learning models in Amazon SageMaker. You can install these SageMaker Operators on your Kubernetes cluster in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to create SageMaker jobs natively using the Kubernetes API and command-line Kubernetes tools such as `kubectl`.

### Operator Deployment

**In the SageMaker Notebook Instance**, open the terminal using "New"/"Terminal" dropdown. (File-New-Terminal if Jupyter Lab)

switch to bash

```shell
bash
```

Create an OpenID Connect Provider for Your Cluster

```shell
# Set the Region and cluster
export AWS_CLUSTER_NAME="kf-sm-workshop"

export AWS_REGION="us-west-2"
```

Use the following command to associate the OIDC provider with your cluster.

```shell
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster ${AWS_CLUSTER_NAME} \
    --region ${AWS_REGION} --approve
```

#### Get the OIDC ID

To set up the ServiceAccount, first obtain the OpenID Connect issuer URL using the following command:

```shell
aws eks describe-cluster --name ${AWS_CLUSTER_NAME} --region ${AWS_REGION} \
    --query cluster.identity.oidc.issuer --output text
```

The command will return a URL like the following:

```shell
https://oidc.eks.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/id/D48675832CA65BD10A532F597OIDCID
```

In this URL, the value `D48675832CA65BD10A532F597OIDCID` is the OIDC ID. The OIDC ID for your cluster will be different. You need this OIDC ID value to create a role.

Create an environment variable for the OIDC ID

```shell

export OIDC_ID="Replace this with the OIDC ID received from above"

```

Create an environment variable for the AWS Account Number. You can execute 
``` aws sts get-caller-identity ``` to see your AWS Account Number.

```shell

export AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER="Replace this with the AWS Account Number"

```
#### Create an IAM Role

First we will use the "trust-placeholder.json" file to create a trust relationship. Navigate to the following folder where the file is located.

```shell

cd /home/ec2-user/SageMaker/aws-ml-workshop/labs/sagemaker-operators-for-k8s

```

The content of the file will look like the following:

```shell

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::$AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/id/$OIDC_ID"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "oidc.eks.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/id/$OIDC_ID:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
          "oidc.eks.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/id/$OIDC_ID:sub": "system:serviceaccount:sagemaker-k8s-operator-system:sagemaker-k8s-operator-default"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This will be used to create an IAM role. To substitute the AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER, OIDC_ID & AWS_REGION in the file with the envrionment variables set earlier, execute the following command

```shell

envsubst < "trust-placeholder.json" > "trust.json"

```

Run the following command to create a role with the trust relationship defined in trust.json. This role enables the Amazon EKS cluster to get and refresh credentials from IAM.

```shell
aws iam create-role --role-name sm-operator-k8s-oidc-role --assume-role-policy-document file://trust.json --output=text
```

Take note of ROLE ARN, you pass this value to your operator.

#### Attach the `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` Policy to the Role

To give the role access to Amazon SageMaker, attach the `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` policy. If you want to limit permissions to the operator, you can create your own custom policy and attach it.

To attach `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess`, run the following command:

```shell
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name sm-operator-k8s-oidc-role  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSageMakerFullAccess

```

The Kubernetes ServiceAccount `sagemaker-k8s-operator-default` should have `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` permissions. Confirm this when you install the operator.

#### Deploy the Operator Using YAML

Download the installer script using the following command:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-operator-for-k8s/master/release/rolebased/installer.yaml
```

**Edit the `installer.yaml` file to replace `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn`. Replace the ARN here with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the OIDC-based role youâ€™ve created**.

Use the following command to deploy the cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -f installer.yaml
```

Verify the operator deployment

```shell
kubectl get crd | grep sagemaker
```

Ensure that the operator pod is running successfully. Use the following command to list all pods:

```shell
kubectl -n sagemaker-k8s-operator-system get pods
```

### Creating an IAM Role for SageMaker

Next, using the commands below, we will create a SageMaker execution role. We will use this role from the SageMaker Job definition files. This role should be different from the one attached to the OIDC provider.

```json
export assume_role_policy_document='{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Service": "sagemaker.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
  }]
}'

```

Run following commands to create `sm-operator-k8s-role` role and attach role policy.

```shell
export SAGEMAKER_IAM_ROLE=sm-operator-k8s-role

aws iam create-role --role-name $SAGEMAKER_IAM_ROLE --assume-role-policy-document file://<(echo "$assume_role_policy_document")

aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name $SAGEMAKER_IAM_ROLE --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSageMakerFullAccess
```
Assign the SageMaker IAM Role Arn to an environment variable

```shell

export SAGEMAKER_IAM_ROLE_ARN="Replace this with SAGEMAKER_IAM_ROLE ARN"

```
#### Create Training Data

We will use the built in SageMaker xgboost container to train an xgboost model using the **MNIST** dataset

To prepare the dataset, you can use the upload_xgboost_mnist_dataset script in the `scripts/upload_xgboost_mnist_dataset` folder.

Use previously created bucket in earlier labs `{prefix}-sfdc-kf-sagemaker-workshop-data`

```shell
export S3_BUCKET={prefix}-sfdc-kf-sagemaker-workshop-data
```

Next, execute the following command in the scripts folder by replacing the bucket name with the bucket you created.

```shell
cd /home/ec2-user/SageMaker/aws-ml-workshop/labs/sagemaker-operators-for-k8s/scripts/upload_xgboost_mnist_dataset

./upload_xgboost_mnist_dataset --s3-bucket $S3_BUCKET --s3-prefix xgboost-mnist
```

This script will upload the training, validation and test data to the S3 bucket.

#### Submitting the Training Jobs

Next, we will use the YAML configuration files to start jobs (training, hpo, deployment etc.) in SageMaker.

Navigate to the `sagemaker-operators-for-k8s` folder

```shell
cd /home/ec2-user/SageMaker/aws-ml-workshop/labs/sagemaker-operators-for-k8s
```

Execute the following command to start the training job by substituting the environment variables in the yaml file(`SAGEMAKER_IAM_ROLE`, `S3_BUCKET` & `AWS_REGION`)

```shell

envsubst < 00-xgboost-mnist-trainingjob.yaml | kubectl create -f -

```

Look up the path for the `model.tar.gz` file generated by the training job in the AWS S3 Console(You can find the model file inside the `output` folder inside the S3 bucket
It should look like the following S3 URL:
`s3://{prefix}-sfdc-kf-sagemaker-workshop-data/xgboost-mnist/xgboost-mnist-fe96de1600c145feaa55485c8a10ba58/output/model.tar.gz`)

Set an environment variable `MODEL_DATA_URL` with the path to the `model.tar.gz` file. Make sure to change the prefix below.

```shell

export MODEL_DATA_URL=s3://{prefix}-sfdc-kf-sagemaker-workshop-data/xgboost-mnist/xgboost-mnist-fe96de1600c145feaa55485c8a10ba58/output/model.tar.gz

```

#### Deploy to SageMaker Endpoint

To deploy trained model to a SageMaker endpoint, use the following command by substituting the environment variables in the yaml file(`SAGEMAKER_IAM_ROLE`, `MODEL_DATA_URL`)

```shell

envsubst < 02-xgboost-mnist-hostingdeployment.yaml | kubectl create -f -

```
